<ul>
<li>
<p>Communication Processes involves  </p>
<ul>
<li>Sender<br />
    -Written communication is best created when the sender keeps in mind the 
    intended audience and purpose of the communication.</li>
<li>Message  </li>
<li>Receiver  </li>
<li>Channel  </li>
<li>Feedback  </li>
<li>Environment  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be interrupted by <strong>Interferencen</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronouse Communication and Asynchronous  </p>
<ul>
<li>Synch (Real-time): Video, phone, face-to-face  </li>
<li>Async: Email, text, voicemail  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-message-and-channel">1.4 Message and Channel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Verbal messages</li>
<li>Non-verbal messages: body gesture  <ul>
<li><strong>Vocalics</strong> or paralanguage: refers to tones, speed, and ptich  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Written message  </li>
<li>
<p>Visual Message</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the amount of information, receiver's emotions, and timeliness  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15-feedback">1.5 Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Positive Feedback - receiver acknowledges receipt, and makes it clear that the 
message was understood    </li>
<li>Negative Feedback - did not receive/understand the message  </li>
<li>Ambiguous Feedback - neither  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="17-interference">1.7 Interference</h3>
<p>Four types of interference<br />
- Physical: background noise<br />
- Psychological: thoughts impact the construction of the message<br />
- Semantic Interference: Creating a message that the reciever does not understand,
with jargon<br />
- Physiological Interference: Headache, faitigue, not wearing glasses  </p>
<h3 id="18-communication-models">1.8 Communication Models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Linear Model: one way process between sender and receiver. The sender does 
not receive feedback  </li>
<li>Interaction Model: adds the reciever's feedback   </li>
<li>Transactional Model: The two parties are both the sender and receiver  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="19-types-of-communication">1.9 Types of Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intrapersonal Communication: communicate with the self  </li>
<li>Interpersonal Communication: Two people  </li>
<li>Group Communication: 3 to 15 people talking at once</li>
<li>Public Communication: One person broadcasting to a group  </li>
<li>Mass Communication: broadcasting out to the masses  </li>

<p>Advantages of Email<br />
- Send a message to one or multiple receivers, including secondary audiences.
- Send information anywhere in the world for free.
- Make it possible to attach documents or images.
- Indefinitely save/store/archive email messages.
- Access emails from any device with an internet connection
- Use the “Reply” feature to carry on email conversations of any length.  </p>
<p>Disadvantages of Email<br />
- Any number of people may have access to your messages, including area administrators in your office, home, or the offices and homes of the receivers.
- Sensitive information may be accidentally forwarded to individuals or groups.
- You might send by mistake with incomplete or incorrect information.
- You might “Reply all” by mistake and send the message to unintended receivers.

- Relational goals:  Conflicts due to relational goals arise when there are 
differences in the way each party wants to be treated.<br />
- Identity goals: Conflicts due to identity arise when there is a misalignment 
between how an individual feels they are perceived by others versus how they perceive their true identity.

<h2 id="25-sources-of-conflict-differing-goals">2.5 Sources of Conflict: Differing Goals</h2>
<p>Conflict episodes can change:<br />
- <strong>Prospective</strong> Goals are those that people hold before a conflict. In other words, 
these are the types of goals, or intentions, that people have before a conflict begins.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transactive</strong> Goals are those that people hold during a conflict. While a conflict 
episode is ongoing, involved parties may change what they want and what is important to them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrospective</strong> Goals are those that people hold after conflict. Once the

<p><strong>Power</strong> is the degree to which a social agent (A) can get another person(s) (P)

<p>Five bases of power:  </p>
<p>1) <strong>Information</strong> -  a social agent’s ability to bring about a change in thought, 
feeling, and/or behavior through information—or to cause conflict by withholding 
information to gain influence.  </p>
<p>2) <strong>Coercive Power</strong> - ability to punish an individual who does not comply with 
one’s attempts to influence them.  </p>
<p>3) <strong>Legitimate Power</strong> - the social agent (A) has a valid right to influence 
them, and they have an obligation to accept A’s attempt to influence their thoughts, 
feelings, and/or behaviors.  </p>
<p>4) <strong>Expert Power</strong> - perceived knowledge and expertise.   </p>

and maintain positive relationships.  </p>
<h2 id="27-escalating-conflict-emotions">2.7 Escalating Conflict: Emotions</h2>

<p>Although emotions are not the initial cause of a conflict, they can escalate a 
conversation into a conflict episode.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent conflict, it is important to refrain from negating others’ emotions.

<th>Characteristic</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Interdependent</td>
<td>The parties somehow need each other.  For example, Alex and her team were working in the same department. They all had a stake in the outcome of their discussions. This is why negotiation is important to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Seeking the best possible result for all</td>
<td>The parties are each looking to achieve the best possible result for all. Although Alex wants a change and her team wants to keep the status quo, they are both acting in what they perceive to be their department’s best interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Motivated and capable of influencing one another</td>
<td>Both parties have enough power to influence and sway the other’s decisions. The team knows that Alex needs them to get her work done. Alex knows that her assignment to the team indicates that it needs her guidance and expertise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Belief in the value of a mutual agreement</td>
<td>The parties believe that it is important to reach a mutual agreement. Both parties believe a middle ground may be reached. They may also be sensitive to the fact that without the other’s cooperation or support, things can actually become more difficult.</td>

<h2 id="34-the-five-steps-of-negotiation-1">3.4 The Five Steps of Negotiation 1</h2>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Prenegotiation</strong>: The first step in the negotiation process where you prepare for 
negotiating.  </p>
<ul>
<li>bring clarity to the conflict, comprehensively analyze the issue, identify 
the stakeholders, and try to determine what each party requires and wants.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opening</strong> step: ensure that the tone and style of your opening statement are
 positive and objective. Try to avoid offering anything, but state the core issues 
 present, demonstrate how they are affecting all parties, and suggest that everyone 
 move forward with an open mind, focusing on the long-term benefits. Actively 
 listen to others’ opening statements as well to make sure you understand their 
 concerns.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploration</strong>: explore all options with an unbiased and objective mind. 
Approach the phase with a spirit of collaboration and cooperation. Interrogate 
and investigate all options to ensure that all perspectives are heard.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bargaining</strong>: try to avoid an aggressive, negative, or argumentative tone or 
style. Do not impose your thoughts and opinions on the other party. Do not try to 
assert control, but rather be humble and sensitive to what the other person is 
saying. Applying bullying tactics at this step will only aggravate the conflict 
and may take you farther away from the agreement step.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agreement</strong>: make sure that everyone’s conditions have been met (even through 
compromise) so that no one complains later and backs down on what was agreed upon.  </p>

<thead>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Be Specific</td>
<td>Tory will need to tell Taylor specifically what they are struggling with. Telling Taylor the documents are frustrating is not helpful, as Taylor will not know how to improve them. To be specific, Tory should say, "the documents you have been sending are not organized well and the formatting is inconsistent."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be Descriptive</td>
<td>Tory will also need to be more detailed in her explanation. For example, she could add to the previous specific sentence by sharing, "when I look through the documents, I am not able to see your flow of ideas because the formatting is inconsistent."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be Positive</td>
<td>The feedback will be better received if Tory is able to add a positive message to her feedback. For example, adding to the above by saying, "I really appreciate your ideas on this team, and I want to be able to take them all into consideration."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be Constructive</td>
<td>Taking it another step forward and providing a constructive, actionable step for Taylor is recommended. For example, Tory could ask Taylor to look over the way a few other team members format their documents and see which ones might feel best to them to try out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be Realistic</td>
<td>Additionally, it is important to be realistic in the feedback you give. Imagine, for example, that Tory said to Taylor, "I don’t really understand what your documents are trying to say." This might be true, but it could have more to do with Tory’s complex literacy skills or the amount of time she is taking to understand Taylor’s work, than with the work itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be Relevant</td>
<td>Lastly, it is critical for Tory to provide feedback that is directly relevant to Taylor’s work. For example, it would not be productive for Tory to share that she liked the 'subject lines' of Taylor’s emails. It is certainly something she could share with Taylor at another time, but for the purposes of effective formal feedback, this is not appropriate or helpful.</td>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storming Stage</strong>: The second stage of group formation, in which group members vie for roles, begin taking sides against others in the group, and resist being managed by self-appointed leaders. Members communicate with each other, but group cohesiveness is overshadowed by individual goals.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assigned Role</strong>: The role assigned to an individual within a group or team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assumed Role</strong>: When a role or responsibility is not assigned to an individual, but they assume it as part of the group dynamic.</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<h2 id="55-active-listening-in-groups">5.5 Active Listening in Groups</h2>
<p><strong>DO:</strong><br />
- Determine their purpose for listening and keep it in mind. 
- Identify the levels at which group members are communicating their messages—e.g., emotional, positional, or intellectual.
- Assess the relative significance of people’s comments and listen for main ideas.
- When possible and appropriate, urge other members of the group to speak, especially those who are less dominant. Speaking can be encouraged with statements like “Please go on,” “Tell me more,” and “Care to expand on that?” 
- Observe others’ body language and other nonverbal cues.
- Show interest in others’ messages through nonverbal actions such as nodding your head. 
- Use "interactive questioning." Ask open-minded and open-ended questions to clarify ideas and information, to probe a speaker’s reasoning and evidence, and to expand incomplete information. Use and ask for examples so that the speaker can connect your questions with their own world of experiences.
- Use tentative clarifying and confirming statements: e.g., "It sounds like . . . ," "You seem to think that . . . ," and "As I understand it, you . . . ."
- Make polite, "targeted" interruptions. Be judicious with interruptions.
- Paraphrase back to the speaker. Don’t just see if you can accurately repeat what a person is saying.
- Respond after listening, sincerely, and constructively. Focus on content, ideas, and analysis rather than on personal matters.
- Allow for, and be careful how you interpret, silence. Keep in mind that people may have many reasons, positive or otherwise, for not speaking at a particular time.</p>
<p><strong>Do NOT:</strong>
- Let listening be a dead end, in which you receive messages and don’t react at all.
- Allow the listening behavior of others to sway your own.
- Cut off or put down a speaker.
- Interrupt excessively.
- Pose "counterfeit questions"—belligerent statements masquerading as questions simply because they end with question marks.
- Allow the tone of someone’s message to influence your interpretation or reactions to it.
- Express your interpretations of other people’s messages excessively.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-to-manage-intragroup-conflict">Strategies to Manage Intragroup Conflict</h3>
<p>1) Emphasizing group goals and effectiveness. Focusing on group goals and objectives helps prevent group conflict. If larger goals are emphasized, group members are more likely to see the big picture and work together to achieve them.</p>
<p>2) Providing stable, well-structured tasks. When work activities are clearly defined, understood, and accepted, conflict is less likely to occur. Conflict is most likely to occur when task uncertainty is high; specifying or structuring roles and tasks minimizes ambiguity.</p>
<p>3) Facilitating dialogue. Misperception of the abilities, goals, and motivations of others often leads to conflict, so efforts to increase dialogue among group members and to share information can help eliminate conflict. As group members come to know more about one another, suspicions often diminish, and greater intergroup teamwork becomes possible.</p>
<p>4) Avoiding win-lose situations. If win-lose situations are avoided, less potential for conflict exists.  </p>
<h3 id="eight-strategies-to-prevent-conflict-episodes">Eight Strategies to prevent Conflict Episodes</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Strategy</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Physical separation</td>
<td>The quickest and easiest solution to resolve the conflict is physical separation. Separation is useful when conflicting individuals or groups are not working on a joint task or do not need a high degree of interaction. Although this approach does not encourage members to change their attitudes, it does provide time to seek better accommodation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use of rules and regulations</td>
<td>Conflict can also be reduced by clearly specifying rules, regulations, and procedures. Again, however, basic attitudes are not modified in this case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use of integrators</td>
<td>Integrators are individuals who are assigned a boundary-spanning role between two people or groups. In this scenario, the project manager was the integrator. To be trusted, integrators must be perceived as legitimate and knowledgeable by both groups. The integrator often takes the “shuttle diplomacy” approach, moving from one person or group to another, identifying areas of agreement, and attempting to find areas of future cooperation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Confrontation and negotiation</td>
<td>In this approach, competing parties are brought together face to face to discuss their basic areas of disagreement. The hope is that through open discussion and negotiation, a means can be found to resolve problems. Contract negotiations between union and management represent one such example. If a “win-win” solution can be identified through these negotiations, the chances of an acceptable resolution of the conflict increase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rotation of members</td>
<td>By rotating from one group to another, individuals come to understand the frames of reference, values, and attitudes of other members, and communication is thus increased. When those rotated are accepted by the receiving groups, a change in attitudes as well as behavior becomes possible. This is clearly a long-term technique, as it takes time to develop good interpersonal relations and understanding among group members.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identification of shared tasks and goals</td>
<td>A further strategy is to establish goals that require groups to work together to achieve overall success.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use of training</td>
<td>The final technique on the continuum is training. Outside training experts are retained on a long-term basis to help groups develop relatively permanent mechanisms for working together. Structured workshops and training programs can help forge more favorable intergroup attitudes and, as a result, more constructive group behavior.</td>

<h2 id="section-2-lesson-5-quiz">Section 2, Lesson 5 Quiz</h2>
<p><strong>Groupthink</strong> is a <strong>negative group phenomenon</strong> characterized by a lack of critical evaluation of proposed courses of action that results from high levels of cohesion and/or high conformity pressures.  </p>
<h2 id="61-conflict-management-styles-1">6.1 Conflict Management Styles 1</h2>
<p><strong>Competing</strong>: Individuals who employ a competing style of conflict management exhibit a low concern for the other and a high concern for self. This is a winner-takes-all attitude. Coercion—either through threats or through persuasion—is a strategy adopted in this style.  </p>
<p><strong>Avoiding</strong>: Individuals who use avoidance as a conflict-management style often indicate a low concern for both self and others. Not addressing the issue and choosing instead to avoid it is one strategy used by this style. Usually, but not always, a strategy of passive-aggressive behavior is used to avoid conflict.  </p>
<p><strong>Accommodating</strong>: An individual with an accommodating style is inclined to have a low concern for self and a high concern for others. While this is often viewed as a submissive and counterproductive position, context and motivation will help determine whether this is an appropriate strategy.  </p>
<p><strong>Compromising</strong>: A compromising approach to conflict indicates a low concern for self and others. While a compromise may look like a reasonable approach, it may arise from indifference and low investment in the outcome, in which case it is not advisable. For it to be equitable, both parties must give up and gain something.  </p>
<p><strong>Collaborating</strong>: A collaborating style of managing conflict indicates high concern for self and others and investment in the outcome. This is an ideal approach, as everyone’s needs are optimally met. However, this may not be feasible in many situations, and hence, the other styles of conflict resolution are used.  </p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modality Principle</strong>: Present words as speech rather than on-screen text when possible.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multimedia Principle</strong>: Use both images and words together to promote processing.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three principles that help viewers interpret the message:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Personalization Principle</strong>: Use a conversational tone that welcomes viewers into the presentation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voice Principle</strong>: Regulate your voice to sound more human than machine.  </p>
