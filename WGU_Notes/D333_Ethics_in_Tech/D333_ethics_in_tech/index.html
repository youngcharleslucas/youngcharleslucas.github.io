</ul>
<p>Sections 1.1-1.7 in Computing and Technology Ethics: Engaging Through Science Fiction.  </p>
<p>Ethical Statements are in two varieties:<br />
- <strong>Normative</strong>: one provides an assessment of how things should be rather than 
how they are. 
    - "he was wrong to do that" 
    - "being kind is more important than being the most successful"<br />
    - What is good and bad<br />
- <strong>Descriptive</strong>: furnishing the decision maker with a critical framework that 
enables you to understand what is happening in a given situation and what is at 
stake in any action you might take.  </p>

</ul>
<h3 id="ethics-vs-morals">Ethics vs Morals</h3>
<p>It is a dispute; are ethics a subset of morals or morals a subset of ethics.<br />
The two definitions are similar.  </p>
<p><strong>Morals</strong>: person's standards of behavior or beliefs concerning what is and is not 
acceptable for them to do. Morals are the personal principles that determine what 
an individual considers to be right or wrong</p>
<p><strong>Ethics</strong>: thoughtful reflection on and application of our standards of behavior 
and beliefs about what is acceptable to do and not to do. Ethics is a code of behavior 
defined by a group an individual belongs to. </p>
<h3 id="invisibility-factor">Invisibility factor</h3>
<p>James Moor presented the potential dangers of an <em>invisibility factor</em> with technology:<br />
- <strong>Invisible abuse</strong>: lower-level operations of a computer to invisibly exploit the 
user who is, for example, transferring money<br />
- <strong>Invisible programming values</strong>: decision-making algorithms that may ensure that 
different people are invisibley advantaged or disadvantaged by the use of an 
algorithm.<br />
- <strong>Invisible complex calculations</strong>: no human is able to inspect code and understand 
completely.  </p>

<li>
<p><strong>Information flow</strong>: easier many-to-many communication  </p>

</ul>
<p>Chapter 2 Computing and Technology Ethics: Engaging Through Science Fiction.  </p>
<p>Frameworks discussed:<br />
- deontology: moral obligation and perscribes or describes moral principles that govern 
action.  <br />
- virtue ethics: center on human character as the locus of moral activity and pays 
special attention to how we develop and exercise good qualities.  <br />
- communitarianism: interdependent nature of human life and examines how that 
interdependence shapes our possibilities for well-being and self-realization.<br />
- unitarianism: prioritizes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of
people and therfore focuses on the outcome of actions.  </p>
<p>Traditions: interpret core principles differently, different approaches to applying 
methods of the framework that they belong to.  </p>
<p>Metaphysics: our understanding of how the world works and the nature of reality, including 
what human beings are and are for.  </p>
<h2 id="dentology">Dentology</h2>
<p><strong>Dentology</strong>: focuses on duties, rights, and moral obligations. Rightness or 
wrongness of actions.<br />
Determined by:<br />
- Social Contracts<br />
- A God or gods<br />
- Human reasoning  </p>
<p><strong>Obligation</strong>: also called positive laws. A part of dentology where you should 
do and that require active effort on the part of the agent.  </p>
<p><strong>Prohibitions</strong>: also called negative laws. A part of dentology, prohibits (forbids)<br />
certain kinds of actions. They are obeyed by refraining from acting in a way that 
has been described as wrong.  </p>
<h3 id="political-authority">Political Authority</h3>
<p><strong>Contractarianism</strong>: example of political authority.  Presumes humans are driven 
by self-interest.  It is decided which self-interests are all common among the 
people, and sign a contract. It is better to cooperate than constantly be at odds 
with eachother. Grew from social contract theory, Thomas Hobbes  </p>
<h3 id="divine-authority">Divine Authority</h3>
<p><strong>Divine command theory</strong>: derives authority from God.  </p>
<p>The Ten Commandments is an example containing <em>obligations</em> and <em>prohibitions</em>.  </p>
<h3 id="authority-of-human-reasoning">Authority of Human Reasoning</h3>
<p>Enlightenment  </p>
<p>St.Thomas Aquinas  </p>
<h3 id="kantian-deontology">Kantian Deontology</h3>
<p>Developed as a response to a growing trend in religious authority.  Rejects 
the idea that any code of law handed down in a religious tradition or promulgated by 
the state can successfully address the full breadth and complexity of right 
and wrong.  </p>
<p>Assumptions:<br />
- All human beings are free and rational 
- They are familiar with both the experience of being moved by the feeling of 
duty or moral obligation. </p>
<p><em>Categorical imperative</em>: a law that is unconditionally and universally valid. 
True freedom is the freedom to act according to a law that you can both apply to 
yoursefl and universally legislate for all.  </p>
<p>An action has no moral worth if it is not done out of duty.  </p>
<h3 id="modalities-for-judgement">Modalities for Judgement</h3>
<ul>
<li>How fundamental is it?  <ul>
<li>Do you choose to protect a stranger or a child, because you have a fundamental role as a parent?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How relevant is it?  <ul>
<li>Do what is Right over what is Good  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Machine Ethics<br />
- Part of these ethics include training AI<br />
    - <em>bottom-up</em> approach: machines are given examples of proper behavior and 
    attempt to abstract from those what to do in situations.<br />
    - <em>top-down</em> approach: agents are given a set of rules and are expected to 
    incorporate the rules in the actions they take.  </p>
<h2 id="virtue-ethics">Virtue Ethics</h2>
<p><em>Virtue ethics</em> is organized around the idea of human flourishing and human excellence. 
All humans share some basic qualities of character, some excell at those characters 
better than others based on experience. Humans are concerned with how to live 
the good life.  </p>
<p>Virtue ethics focuses on the whole person: the qualities of character that they have 
and the patterns of living that issue from and reveal those qualities.<br />
<strong>habitus</strong> is the pattern. Interlocking set of habits that are what feels right or natural for a person.  <br />
<strong>Virtues</strong> is cultivating excellence in a range of basic humand capacities.<br />
- Nobody is bor virtuous. 
- It takes continual practice.
- It is goal-driven, for the creation of good outcomes<br />
- We all start out with the same tool set of virtues. It is up to us to develop 
the virtues.  </p>

The fact that these appetites and desires are a basic part of human nature means 
that they are fundamentally good for humans, and necessary for humans to flourish. <br />
Suppressing these appetites entirely is jas as damaging to a person as allowing them to 
expand out of control.<br />
Virtue places value on learning to regulate appetites and desires, exercise moderation.  </p>
<p><strong>Continence</strong>: the forcible restraint of one's own appetite or desire. It is not 
a virtue because it requires us to suppress our desires and appetites.  </p>
<p><strong>Temperance</strong>: training yourself to do what is right.<br />
<strong>Wholeheartedness</strong>: temperance in the terms of Confucius. One does not feel 
internal resistance or conflict but is genuinely and joyfully committed to a 
course of action.    </p>
<p>Virtue is a spectrum, not binary.  </p>
<p><strong>Practical Wisdom</strong>: ability to judge what the best action would be in any given 
situation.  </p>
<h2 id="communitarianism">Communitarianism</h2>
<p>Communitarianism is an approach to ethics organized around self-realization in 
the context of interdependence.  Its basic assumption is that human 
beings exist in a state of mutual reliance on one another.   </p>
<p>Communities existed prior to any individual born and raised within them.  </p>
<p><em>sympathetic awareness</em> of others.  </p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong>: comes from a family of Bantu languages.  Refers to a crucial 
quality that is central to communitarianism of southern and eastern Africa. Another 
general definition is to engage in the process of becoming and being human.  </p>
<p><strong>Yoruba</strong>: Based in now Nigeria. Hearing is the foundation for how we percieve the
world.  </p>
<h2 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h2>
<p>Utilitarianism is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of happiness. 
Humans are motivated to be happy. Which acts bring joy to the most amount of people. </p>
<p><strong>Principle of utility</strong> or <strong>greatest happiness principle</strong>: Decide on the actions
that bring happiness to the most amount of people.  </p>
<p>John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, proponent of utilitarianism  </p>
<p>Form of consequentialism, consequences determine the moral worth of an action.  </p>
<p>No one person's happiness is more valuable than anothers.  </p>

<p>Ethics in Information Technology  </p>
<p><strong>Ethics</strong>: is a code of behavior that is defined by the group to which an individual 
belongs. Ethical behavior conforms to generally accepted norms, which may change 
over time.  </p>
<p><strong>Morals</strong> are the personal principles upon which an individual bases his or her 
decisions about what is right and what is wrong. They are core beliefs formed 
and adhered to by an individual.  </p>
<p>A <strong>virtue</strong> is a habit that inclines people to do what is acceptable</p>
<p>A <strong>vice</strong> is a habit of unacceptable behavior.  </p>
<p>A person who acts with <strong>integrity</strong> acts in accordance with a personal code of 
principles. One approach to acting with integrity is to extend to all people 
the same respect and consideration that you expect to receive from them.  </p>
<p><strong>Law</strong> is a system of rules that tells us what we can and cannot do. Laws are enforced 
by a set of institutions (the police, courts, law-making bodies). Violation of 
a law can result in censure, fines, and/or imprisonment.  </p>
<p>generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP)  </p>
<p>The moral corruption of people in power, which is often facilitated by a tendency 
for people to look the other way when their leaders act inappropriately has been 
given the name <strong>Bathsheba syndrome</strong>—a reference to the biblical story of King 
David, who became corrupted by his power and success.  </p>
<p><strong>Corporate social responsibility (CSR)</strong> is the concept that an organization should 
act ethically by taking responsibility for the impact of its actions on its 
shareholders, consumers, employees, community, environment, and suppliers.  </p>
<p><strong>Supply chain sustainability</strong> is a component of CSR that focuses on developing 
and maintaining a supply chain that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  </p>
<p>Why a business should pursue CSR:<br />
- Gaining the goodwill of the community<br />
- Creating an organization that operates consistently<br />
- Fostering good business practices<br />
- Protecting the organization and its employees from legal action<br />
- Avoiding unfavorable publicity  </p>
<p>A <strong>stakeholder</strong> is someone who stands to gain or lose, depending on how a particular 
situation is resolved.  </p>
<p>Appoint a Corporate Ethics Officer  </p>
<p>A <strong>corporate ethics officer</strong> (also called a corporate compliance officer) 
provides an organization with vision and leadership in the area of business 
conduct. This individual “aligns the practices of a workplace with the stated 
ethics and beliefs of that workplace, holding people accountable to ethical 
standards.” Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsibility for compliance—that is, ensuring that ethical procedures are put into place and consistently adhered to throughout the organization</li>
<li>Responsibility for creating and maintaining the ethics culture envisioned by the highest level of corporate authority</li>
<li>Responsibility for being a key knowledge and contact person on issues relating to corporate ethics and principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Require the Board of Directors to Set and Model High Ethical Standards  </p>
<p>Establish a Corporate Code of Ethics  </p>
<p>A <strong>code of ethics</strong> is a statement that highlights an organization’s key 
ethical issues and identifies the overarching values and principles that are 
important to the organization and its decision making.</p>
<p>Conduct Social Audits  </p>
<p>An increasing number of organizations conduct regular social audits of their 
policies and practices. In a <strong>social audit</strong>, an organization reviews how well it 
is meeting its ethical and social responsibility goals and communicates its new 
goals for the upcoming year.  </p>
<p>Require employees to take Ethics training  </p>
<p>Include Ethical Criteria in Employee Appraisals  </p>
<p>Create an Ethical Work Environment  </p>
<p>Include Ethical Considerations in Decision Making  </p>

<h3 id="professional-guidelines-for-algorithms-bias-transparency-accountability">Professional guidelines for Algorithms: Bias, Transparency, Accountability</h3>
<ol>
<li>Awareness: Owners, designers, builders, users, and other stakeholders of analytic systems should be aware of the possible biases involved in their design, implementation, and use and the potential harm that biases can cause to individuals and society.</li>
<li>Access and redress: Regulators should encourage the adoption of mechanisms that enable questioning and redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by algorithmically informed decisions.</li>
<li>Accountability: Institutions should be held responsible for decisions made by the algorithms that they use, even if it is not feasible to explain in detail how the algorithms produce their results.</li>
<li>Explanation: Systems and institutions that use algorithmic decision-making are encouraged to produce explanations regarding both the procedures followed by the algorithm and the specific decisions that are made. This is particularly important in public policy contexts.</li>
<li>Data Provenance: A description of the way in which the training data was collected should be maintained by the builders of the algorithms, accompanied by an exploration of the potential biases induced by the human or algorithmic data-gathering process. Public scrutiny of the data provides maximum opportunity for corrections. However, concerns over privacy, protecting trade secrets, or revelation of analytics that might allow malicious actors to game the system can justify restricting access to qualified and authorized individuals.</li>
<li>Auditability: Models, algorithms, data, and decisions should be recorded so that they can be audited in cases where harm is suspected.</li>
<li>Validation and Testing: Institutions should use rigorous methods to validate their models and document those methods and results. In particular, they should routinely perform tests to assess and determine whether the model generates discriminatory harm. Institutions are encouraged to make the results of such tests public.</li>

<h3 id="suggestions-on-making-ethical-decsions-in-practice">Suggestions on Making ethical decsions in practice</h3>
<p>Within the framework of utilitarianism, Harris et al. (2013) outline three possible approaches for solving moral disagreements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost-benefit analysis approach, where one attempts to quantify all the various costs and benefits to all the relevant parties to a decision.</li>
<li>The act-utilitarian approach, where one tries to determine for each possible action what the benefits and consequences of each are and selects the one that brings about the greatest good.</li>
<li>The rule-utilitarian approach, where one works to find rules that are justified by their utility.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods lead to a set of approaches that bear a close resemblance to the 
deontological and virtue ethics approaches:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The golden rule approach, which enjoins one to think about what would happen if others acted as we are considering.
The self-defeating approach, which is a version of negative universalization that asks the question: if everyone were to act this way, would it invalidate the action or the usefulness of that action?
And finally the rights approach, which starts from the position that all persons have a set of rights (e.g., life, physical integrity, and the right not to be deceived or cheated), and that actions should not infringe on these rights. Hence in order to make a decision, one should list the rights that are relevant and then choose an action that does not impinge this set of rights.</p>

<p><strong>Negligence</strong> is defined as not doing something that a reasonable person would do or doing something that a reasonable person would not do.</p>
<p><strong>Duty of care</strong> refers to the obligation to protect people against any unreasonable harm or risk.</p>
<p>The courts decide whether parties owe a duty of care by applying a <strong>reasonable person standard</strong> to evaluate how an objective, careful, and conscientious person would have acted in the same circumstances.</p>
<p>Defendants who have particular expertise or competence are measured against a <strong>reasonable professional standard</strong>. For example, in a medical malpractice suit based on improper treatment of a broken bone, the standard of measure would be higher if the defendant were an orthopedic surgeon rather than a general practitioner.  </p>
<p>If a court finds that a defendant actually owed a duty of care, it must then determine whether the duty was breached. A breach of the duty of care is the failure to act as a reasonable person would act. A <strong>breach of duty</strong> might consist of an action, such as throwing a lit cigarette into a fireworks factory  </p>
<p><strong>Professional Malpractice</strong>: Professionals who breach the duty of care are liable for injuries that their negligence causes.  </p>

<h1 id="cyberattacks-and-cybersecurity-section-2-module-4">Cyberattacks and Cybersecurity, Section 2, module 4</h1>
<p>A <strong>zero-day exploit</strong> is a cyberattack that takes place before the security community and/or software developers become aware of and fix a security vulnerability.  </p>
<p><strong>Vulnerability Equities Process (VEP)</strong>: a policy where the government witholds 
known vulnerabilities to venders (zero-day attacks).  </p>
<p>Under VEP, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found an exception that allowed it to refuse to reveal the vulnerability that enabled it to hack into the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter who killed 14 people in late 2015.  </p>
<p>Tradeoffs when making IT security:<br />
- How much effort and money should be spent to safeguard against computer crime? (In other words, how safe is safe enough?)
- What should be done if recommended computer security safeguards make conducting business more difficult for customers and employees, resulting in lost sales and increased costs?
- If a firm is a victim of a cybercrime, should it pursue prosecution of the criminals at all costs, maintain a low profile to avoid the negative publicity, inform affected customers, or take some other action?  </p>
<p>An <strong>exploit</strong> is an attack on an information system that takes advantage of a particular system vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Black hat hacker</strong>: Someone who violates computer or Internet security maliciously or for illegal personal gain (in contrast to a white hat hacker who is someone who has been hired by an organization to test the security of its information systems)</p>
<p><strong>Malicious insider</strong>: An employee or contractor who attempts to gain financially and/or disrupt a company’s information systems and business operations  </p>
<p><strong>Industrial spy</strong>: An individual who captures trade secrets and attempts to gain an unfair competitive advantage  </p>
<p><strong>Cybercriminal</strong>: Someone who attacks a computer system or network for financial gain  </p>
<p><strong>Hacktivist</strong>: An individual who hacks computers or websites in an attempt to promote a political ideology</p>
<p><strong>Cyberterrorist</strong>: Someone who attempts to destroy the infrastructure components of governments, financial institutions, and other corporations, utilities, and emergency response units</p>
<p><strong>Ransomware</strong>: is malware that stops you from using your computer or accessing your data until you meet certain demands  </p>
<p><strong>Virus</strong> is a piece of programming code, usually disguised as something else, that causes a computer to behave in an unexpected and usually undesirable manner. For example, a virus may be programmed to display a certain message on an infected computer’s display screen, delete or modify a certain document, or reformat the hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Worm</strong>: is a harmful program that resides in the active memory of the computer and duplicates itself. Worms differ from viruses in that they can propagate without human intervention, often sending copies of themselves to other computers by email.</p>
<p><strong>Trojan</strong> horse is a seemingly harmless program in which malicious code is hidden. A victim on the receiving end of a Trojan horse is usually tricked into opening it because it appears to be useful software from a legitimate source, such as an update for software the user currently has installed on his or her computer. The program’s harmful payload might be designed to enable the hacker to destroy hard drives, corrupt files, control the computer remotely, launch attacks against other computers, steal passwords, or spy on users by recording keystrokes and transmitting them to a server operated by a third party. A Trojan horse often creates a “backdoor” on a computer that enables an attacker to gain future access to the system and compromise confidential or private information.</p>
<p>Another type of Trojan horse is a <strong>logic bomb</strong>, which executes when it is triggered by a specific event. For example, logic bombs can be triggered by a change in a particular file, by typing a specific series of keystrokes, or at a specific time or date.</p>
<p>A <strong>blended threat</strong> is a sophisticated threat that combines the features of a virus, worm, Trojan horse, and other malicious code into a single payload.</p>
<p>The <strong>Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act</strong> states that it is legal to spam, provided the messages meet a few basic requirements—spammers cannot disguise their identity by using a false return address, the email must include a label specifying that it is an ad or a solicitation, and the email must include a way for recipients to indicate that they do not want future mass mailings.</p>
<p>A partial solution to this problem is the use of CAPTCHA to ensure that only humans obtain free accounts. <strong>CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</strong> attack is one in which a malicious hacker takes over computers via the Internet and causes them to flood a target site with demands for data and other small tasks.
- The term <strong>botnet</strong> is used to describe a large group of such computers, which are controlled from one or more remote locations by hackers, without the knowledge or consent of their owners.
- botnet computers are called <strong>zombies</strong>  </p>
<p>A <strong>rootkit</strong> is a set of programs that enables its user to gain administrator-level access to a computer without the end user’s consent or knowledge. Once installed, the attacker can gain full control of the system and even obscure the presence of the rootkit from legitimate system administrators.
- Rootkits are one part of a type of blended threat that consists of a dropper, a loader, and a rootkit. <br />
- The dropper code gets the rootkit installation started and can be activated by clicking on a link to a malicious website in an email or opening an infected PDF file. The dropper launches the loader program and then deletes itself. 
- The loader loads the rootkit into memory; 
- at that point, the computer has been compromised.  </p>
<p>An <strong>advanced persistent threat (APT)</strong> is a network attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and stays there—undetected—with the intention of stealing data over a long period of time (weeks or even months). </p>
<p>Steps for APT:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Reconnaissance—The intruder begins by conducting reconnaissance on the network to gain useful information about the target (security software installed, computing resources connected to the network, number of users).</li>
<li>Incursion—The attacker next launches incursions to gain access to the network at a low level to avoid setting off any alarms or suspicion. Some forms of spear phishing may be employed in this phase. After gaining entrance, the attacker establishes a back door, or a means of accessing a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms.</li>
<li>Discovery—The intruder now begins a discovery process to gather valid user credentials (especially administrative ones) and move laterally across the network, installing more back doors. These back doors enable the attacker to install bogus utilities for distributing malware that remains hidden in plain sight.</li>
<li>Capture—The attacker is now ready to access unprotected or compromised systems and capture information over a long period of time.</li>

<p><strong>phishing</strong> is the act of fraudulently using email to try to get the recipient to reveal personal data. </p>
<p><strong>Spear phishing</strong> is a variation of phishing in which the phisher sends fraudulent emails to a certain organization’s employees.</p>
<p><strong>Smishing</strong> is another variation of phishing that involves the use of texting. In a smishing scam, people receive a legitimate-looking text message</p>
<p><strong>Vishing</strong> is similar to smishing except that the victims receive a voice-mail message telling them to call a phone number or access a website  </p>
<p><strong>Cyberespionage</strong> involves the deployment of malware that secretly steals data in the computer systems of organizations, such as government agencies, military contractors, political organizations, and manufacturing firms. The type of data most frequently targeted includes data that can provide an unfair competitive advantage to the perpetrator. </p>
<p><strong>Cyberterrorism</strong> is the intimidation of government or civilian population by using information technology to disable critical national infrastructure  </p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</strong> is a large federal agency with more than 240,000 employees and a budget of almost $65 billion whose goal is to provide for a “safer, more secure America, which is resilient against terrorism and other potential threats.” The agency was formed in 2002 when 22 different federal departments and agencies were combined into a unified, integrated cabinet agency  </p>
<p>The DHS website (www.dhs.gov) provides a link that enables users to report cyber incidents. Incident reports go to the US-CERT Incident Reporting System, which assists analysts at the <strong>U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)</strong> (a partnership between the DHS and the public and private sectors) in providing timely handling of security incidents as well as in conducting improved analysis of such incidents.  </p>

<p>the <strong>right of privacy</strong> is “the right to be left alone—the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.”</p>
<p><strong>information privacy</strong> is the combination of communications privacy (the ability to communicate with others without those communications being monitored by other persons or organizations) and data privacy (the ability to limit access to one’s personal data by other individuals and organizations in order to exercise a substantial degree of control over that data and their use)</p>

<p><strong>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681)</strong> (1970) regulates the operations of credit reporting bureaus, including how they collect, store, and use credit information. The act, enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</p>
<p><strong>The Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. § 3401)</strong> (1978) protects the records of financial institution customers from unauthorized scrutiny by the federal government. Prior to the passage of this act, financial institution customers were not informed if their personal records were being turned over for review by a government authority
The customer must also be given written procedures to follow if he or she does not wish the records to be made available. In addition, to gain access to a customer’s financial records, the government must obtain one of the following:
- an authorization signed by the customer that identifies the records, the reasons the records are requested, and the customer’s rights under the act;
- an appropriate administrative or judicial subpoena or summons;
- a qualified search warrant or a formal written request by a government agency (can be used only if no administrative summons or subpoena authority is available).</p>
<p><strong>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) (Public Law 106-102)</strong>, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, was a bank deregulation law that repealed a Depression-era law known as Glass-Steagall
Glass-Steagall prohibited any one institution from offering investment, commercial banking, and insurance services; individual companies were only allowed to offer one of those types of financial service products.<br />
GLBA also included three key rules that affect personal privacy:<br />
- <em>Financial Privacy Rule</em>: This rule established mandatory guidelines for the collection and disclosure of personal financial information by financial organizations. Under this provision, financial institutions must provide a privacy notice to each consumer that explains what data about the consumer are gathered, with whom that data are shared, how the data are used, and how the data are protected.<br />

- <em>Pretexting Rule</em>: This rule addresses attempts by people to access personal information without proper authority by means such as impersonating an account holder or phishing. GLBA encourages financial institutions to implement safeguards against pretexting.</p>
<p><strong>The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (Public Law 108-159)</strong> was passed in 2003 as an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and it allows consumers to request and obtain a free credit report once each year from each of the three primary consumer credit reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion)
Also established the National Fraud Alert system. Consumers can place an alert for fraud.  </p>

<p><strong>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (Public Law 104-191)</strong> (1996) was designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage; to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in health insurance and healthcare delivery; and to simplify the administration of health insurance.</p>
<p><strong>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111-5)</strong> is a wide-ranging act passed in 2009 that authorized $787 billion in spending and tax cuts over a 10-year period. Title XIII, Subtitle D, of this act (known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH) included strong privacy provisions for electronic health records (EHRs), including banning the sale of health information, promoting the use of audit trails and encryption, and providing rights of access for patients.</p>

<p><strong>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g)</strong>(1974) is a federal law that assigns certain rights to parents regarding their children’s educational records. These rights transfer to the student once the student reaches the age of 18,
- the right to access educational records maintained by a school;
- the right to demand that educational records be disclosed only with student consent;
- the right to amend educational records; and
- the right to file complaints against a school for disclosing educational records in violation of FERPA.</p>
<p><strong>According to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506)</strong>(1998), any website that caters to children must offer comprehensive privacy policies, notify parents or guardians about its data collection practices, and receive parental consent before collecting any personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<p><img alt="surveillance" src="../images/surveillance.png" />  </p>
<p><strong>Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (Public Law 90-351)</strong>, also known as the Wiretap Act, regulates the interception of wire (telephone) and oral communications. It allows state and federal law enforcement officials to use wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, but only under strict limitations. Under this act, a warrant must be obtained from a judge to conduct a wiretap</p>
<p><strong>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)(50 U.S.C.)</strong> describes procedures for the electronic surveillance and collection of foreign intelligence information in communications between foreign powers and the agents of foreign powers.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Executive Order 12333</strong>, intelligence-gathering agencies are allowed to collect information—including message content—obtained in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, international drug, or international terrorism investigation, as well as incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local, or foreign laws

<p>The <strong>Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) (18 U.S.C. § 2510-22)</strong> (1986) deals with three main issues:
- Protect communications while in transfer from sender to receiver<br />
- Protection of communications held in electronic storage<br />
- Prohibition of devices from recording dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling 
information without a search warrant.  </p>
<p>The third part of ECPA establishes a requirement for court-approved law enforcement use of a <strong>pen register</strong>—a device that records electronic impulses to identify the numbers dialed for outgoing calls—or a <strong>trap and trace</strong>—a device that records the originating number of incoming calls for a particular phone number.</p>
<p><strong>The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (47 U.S.C. 1001-1010)</strong> was passed by Congress in 1994 and amended both the Wiretap Act and ECPA. CALEA was a hotly debated law because it required the telecommunications industry to build tools into its products that federal investigators could use—after obtaining a court order—to eavesdrop on conversations and intercept electronic communications. </p>

Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension:<br />
- For works created after January 1, 1978, copyright protection endures for the life of the author plus 70 years.
- For works created but not published or registered before January 1, 1978, the term endures for the life of the author plus 70 years, but in no case expires earlier than December 31, 2004.
- For works created before 1978 that are still in their original or renewable term of copyright, the total term was extended to 95 years from the date the copyright was originally secured.</p>
<p>Eligible works include: architecture, art, audiovisual works, choreography, drama, graphics, literature, motion pictures, music, pantomimes, pictures, sculptures, sound recordings, and other intellectual works, as described in Title 17 of the U.S. Code</p>

<p>Title 35 of the U.S. Code. Section 101  </p>
<p>A <strong>patent</strong> is a grant of a property right issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to an inventor. A patent permits its owner to exclude the public from making, using, or selling a protected invention, and it allows for legal action against violators. <em>Unlike a copyright, a patent prevents independent creation as well as copying.</em>   </p>
<p>There are six types of patents.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>utility patent</strong> is “issued for the invention of a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or a new and useful improvement thereof, it generally permits its owner to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention for a period of up to twenty years from the date of patent application.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A design patent, which is “issued for a new, original, and ornamental design embodied in or applied to an article of manufacture,” permits its owner to exclude others from making, using, or selling the design in question. Design patents issued from applications filed on or after May 13, 2015, are granted for a term of 15 years from the date of grant.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that three classes of items cannot be patented: abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena.   </p>
<p><strong>patent infringement</strong>, or the violation of the rights secured by the owner of a patent, occurs when someone makes unauthorized use of another’s patent. Unlike with copyright infringement, there is no specified dollar amount limitation on the monetary penalty if patent infringement is found.  </p>
<p>Passed in 2011, the <strong>Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which amends Title 35 of the U.S. Code</strong>: Under this law, the U.S. patent system changed from a “first-to-invent” to a “first-inventor-to-file”  </p>
<h3 id="cross-licensing-agreements">Cross-Licensing Agreements</h3>
<p>Many large software companies have cross-licensing agreements in which each party agrees not to sue the other over patent infringements.  </p>
<h2 id="trade-secrets">Trade Secrets</h2>
<p>A <strong>trade secret</strong> is defined as business information that represents something of economic value, has required effort or cost to develop, has some degree of uniqueness or novelty, is generally unknown to the public, and is kept confidential.</p>
<p>Trade secret law protects only against the misappropriation of trade secrets. If competitors come up with the same idea on their own, it is not misappropriation;  </p>
<ul>
<li>There are no time limitations on the protection of trade secrets, as there are with patents and copyrights.</li>
<li>There is no need to file an application, make disclosures to any person or agency, or disclose a trade secret to outsiders to gain protection. (After the USPTO issues a patent, competitors can obtain a detailed description of it.) Hence, no filing or application fees are required to protect a trade secret.</li>
<li>Although patents can be ruled invalid by the courts, meaning that the affected inventions no longer have patent protection, this risk does not exist for trade secrets.</li>

<h2 id="trademark-infringement">Trademark Infringement</h2>
<p>A <strong>trademark</strong> is a logo, package design, phrase, sound, or word that enables a consumer to differentiate one company’s products from another’s. </p>
<p>Nominative fair use is a defense often employed by the defendant in trademark infringement cases in which a defendant has used a plaintiff’s mark to identify the plaintiff’s products or services:<br />
- that the plaintiff’s product or service cannot be readily identifiable without using the plaintiff’s mark,
- that it uses only as much of the plaintiff’s mark as necessary to identify the defendant’s product or service, and
- that the defendant does nothing with the plaintiff’s mark that suggests endorsement or sponsorship by the plaintiff.  </p>

<h3 id="software-quality-and-why-it-is-important">Software Quality and Why it is Important</h3>
<p>A <strong>software</strong> defect is any error that, if not removed, could cause a software system to fail to meet its users’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>software quality</strong> is the degree to which a software product meets the needs of its users</p>
<p><strong>quality management</strong> focuses on defining, measuring, and refining the quality of the development process and the products developed during its various stages. </p>
<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>: product delivered to customer  </p>
<h3 id="software-product-liability">Software Product Liability</h3>
<p>The liability of manufacturers, sellers, lessors, and others for injuries caused by defective products is commonly referred to as <strong>product liability</strong>.  </p>
<p>There is no federal product liability law; instead, product liability in the United States is mainly covered by common law (made by state judges) and Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which deals with the sale of goods.  </p>
<p><strong>strict liability</strong> means that the defendant is held responsible for injuring another person, regardless of negligence or intent</p>
<p>The defendant in a negligence case may either answer the charge with a legal justification for the alleged misconduct or demonstrate that the plaintiffs’ own actions contributed to their injuries (<strong>contributory negligence</strong>).</p>
<p>A <strong>warranty</strong> assures buyers or lessees that a product meets certain standards of quality. A warranty of quality may be either expressly stated or implied by law.  </p>
<h2 id="strategies-for-developing-quality-software">Strategies for developing Quality Software</h2>
<h3 id="software-development-methedologies">Software Development Methedologies</h3>
<p><strong>software development methodology</strong> —a standard, proven work process that enables systems analysts, programmers, project managers, and others to make controlled and orderly progress in developing high-quality software. </p>
<p><img alt="componente_methedologies" src="../images/componente_methedologies.png" />  </p>
<p><img alt="methodoloy_comparison" src="../images/methodoloy_comparison.png" />  </p>
<p><strong>quality assurance (QA)</strong> refers to methods within the development process that are designed to guarantee reliable operation of a product. Ideally, these methods are applied at each stage of the development cycle.</p>
<p>One approach to QA is to test the code for a completed unit of software by actually entering test data and comparing the results to the expected results in a process called <strong>dynamic testing</strong>.
Two types of dynamic testing:<br />
- <strong>black-box testing</strong> involves viewing the software unit as a device that has expected input and output behaviors but whose internal workings are unknown (a black box).
- <strong>white-box testing</strong> treats the software unit as a device that has expected input and output behaviors but whose internal workings, unlike the unit in black-box testing, are known.</p>
<p>Other types of testing:<br />
- <strong>static testing</strong>—This is a software-testing technique in which software is tested without actually executing the code. It consists of two steps—review and static analysis.<br />
    - Review: informal, walk-through, peer review, and inspection<br />
    - During the static analysis step, special software programs called static analyzers are run against the code. Rather than reviewing input and output, the static analyzer looks for suspicious patterns in programs that might indicate a defect.<br />
- <strong>unit testing</strong>: This involves testing individual components of code (subroutines, modules, and programs) to verify that each unit performs as intended. 
- <strong>integration testing</strong>: After successful unit testing, the software units are combined into an integrated subsystem that undergoes rigorous testing to ensure that the linkages among the various subsystems work successfully.
- <strong>system testing</strong>: After successful integration testing, the various subsystems are combined to test the entire system as a complete entity.
- <strong>user acceptance testing</strong>: Trained end users conduct independent user acceptance testing to ensure that the system operates as they expect.</p>
<h3 id="capability-maturity-model-integration">Capability Maturity Model Integration</h3>
<p>Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) models are collections of best practices that help organizations improve their processes. </p>
<p>A <strong>best practice</strong> is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and that is used as a benchmark within a particular industry. </p>
<p>CMMI-Development (CMMI-DEV)—is frequently used to assess and improve software development practices.<br />
CMMI-DEV is a set of guidelines for 22 process areas related specifically to systems development.  </p>
<p>Five Levels of Software Development Maturity:<br />
<img alt="CCMI_maturity" src="../images/CCMI_maturity.png" />  </p>
<h3 id="developing-safety-critical-systems">Developing Safety-Critical Systems</h3>
<p>A <strong>safety-critical</strong> system is one whose failure may cause human injury or death. The safe operation of many safety-critical systems relies on the flawless performance of software.</p>
<p>The key to ensuring that these additional tasks are completed is to appoint a <strong>system safety engineer</strong>, who has explicit responsibility for the system’s safety. The safety engineer uses a logging and monitoring system to track hazards from a project’s start to its finish.</p>
<p>This <strong>hazard log</strong> is used at each stage of the software development process to assess how it has accounted for detected hazards. </p>
<h3 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h3>
<p><strong>risk</strong> is the potential of gaining or losing something of value.<br />
Risk can be quantified by three elements: a risk event, the probability of the event happening, and the impact (positive or negative) on the business outcome if the risk does actually occur  </p>
<p>The <strong>annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)</strong> is an estimate of the probability that this event will occur over the course of a year. </p>
<p>The <strong>single loss expectancy (SLE)</strong> is the estimated loss that would be incurred if the event happens. </p>
<p>The <strong>annualized loss expectancy (ALE)</strong> is the estimated loss from this risk over the course of a year.  </p>
<p><code>ARO x SLE = ALE =&gt; 0.01 x $1,000,000 = $10,000</code>  </p>
<p><strong>risk management</strong> is the process of identifying, monitoring, and limiting risks to a level that an organization is willing to accept. 
 The level of risk that remains after managing risk is called residual risk.   </p>
<p><strong>acceptance</strong> —When the cost of avoiding a risk outweighs the potential loss of a risk, an organization will likely accept the risk.   </p>
<p><strong>avoidance</strong>—An organization may choose to eliminate the vulnerability that gives rise to a particular risk in order to avoid the risk altogether.  </p>
<p><strong>mitigation</strong> —Risk mitigation involves the reduction in either the likelihood or the impact of the occurrence of a risk<br />
    -  <strong>N-version programming</strong> is an approach to minimizing the impact of software errors by independently implementing the same set of user requirements N times. So multiple teams are building the same product. The idea is that each team might cover a different aspect, so it is less likely all version will fail.  </p>
<p><strong>redundancy</strong> is the provision of multiple interchangeable components to perform a single function in order to cope with failures and errors.</p>
<p><strong>transference</strong>—A common way to accomplish risk transference is for an individual or an organization to purchase insurance, such as auto or business liability insurance. </p>
<p><strong>reliability</strong> is a measure of the rate of failure in a system that would render it unusable over its expected lifetime.  </p>
<h3 id="quality-management-standards">Quality Management Standards</h3>
<p>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</p>
<p><strong>ISO 9001 family of standards</strong> serves as a guide to quality products, services, and management.<br />
- Have written procedures for all processes
- Follow those procedures
- Prove to an auditor that it has fulfilled the first two requirements; this proof can require observation of actual work practices and interviews with customers, suppliers, and employees</p>
<p><strong>failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)</strong> is an important technique used to develop ISO 9000–compliant quality systems by both evaluating reliability and determining the effects of system and equipment failures.
The use of FMEA helps to prioritize those actions necessary to reduce potential failures with the highest relative risks.  </p>
<p>A <strong>failure mode</strong> describes how a product or process could fail to perform the desired functions described by the customer.</p>
<p>An <strong>effect</strong> is an adverse consequence that the customer might experience. </p>

<h3 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>artificial intelligence systems</strong> include the people, procedures, hardware, software, data, and knowledge needed to develop computer systems and machines that can simulate human intelligence processes, including <em>learning</em> (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), <em>reasoning</em> (using rules to reach conclusions), and <em>self-correction</em> (using the outcome from one scenario to improve its performance on future scenarios).</p>
<p><strong>machine learning</strong>, a type of artificial intelligence (AI), involves computer programs that can learn some task and improve their performance with experience.
- a model<br />
- parameter<br />
- learner  </p>
<p>The learner component of the system compares the prediction with reality and uses the difference between the two to modify the parameters that are used in the model. This learning process is repeated until the learning system is able to make predictions that are sufficiently accurate.<br />
<img alt="machine_learning" src="../images/machine_learning.png" />  </p>
<p>Machine learning is employed in a wide spectrum of computing functions in which designing and programming explicit algorithms is not feasible.  </p>
<p><strong>robotics</strong> is a branch of engineering that involves the development and manufacture of mechanical or computer devices that can perform tasks that require a high degree of precision or that are tedious or hazardous for human beings, such as painting cars or making precision welds.  </p>
<p><strong>natural language processing</strong> is an aspect of artificial intelligence that involves technology that allows computers to understand, analyze, manipulate, and/or generate “natural” languages, such as English. Many companies provide natural language processing help over the phone  </p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-it-on-health-care">The Impact of IT on Health Care</h2>
<h3 id="computerized-patient-records">Computerized Patient Records</h3>
<p>An <strong>electronic medical record (EMR)</strong> is a collection of health-related information on an individual that is created, managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians and staff within a single healthcare organization.  </p>
<p>An EHR, on the other hand, is a comprehensive view of the patient’s complete medical history designed to be shared with authorized providers and staff from more than one organization.   </p>
<p><strong>health information exchange (HIE)</strong> is the process of sharing patient-level electronic health information between different organizations. HIE can result in more cost-effective and higher-quality care.  </p>
<p>A <strong>personal health record (PHR)</strong> includes those portions of the EHR that are routinely shared with the patient—such as personal identifiers, contact information, health provider information, problem list, medication history, allergies, immunizations, and lab and test results. </p>
<h3 id="clinical-decision-support">Clinical Decision Support</h3>
<p><strong>clinical decision support (CDS)</strong> is a process and a set of tools designed to enhance healthcare-related decision making through the use of clinical knowledge and patient-specific information to improve healthcare delivery.</p>
<h3 id="computerized-provider-order-entry">Computerized Provider Order Entry</h3>
<p>A <strong>computerized provider order entry (CPOE)</strong> system enables physicians to place orders (for drugs, laboratory tests, radiology, physical therapy) electronically, with the orders transmitted directly to the recipient. CPOE streamlines the ordering process because lab techs, nurses, and pharmacy staffs do not need to seek clarification or solicit missing information due to illegible or incomplete orders.</p>
<h3 id="telehealth">Telehealth</h3>
<p><strong>telehealth</strong> employs electronic information processing and telecommunications to support at-a-distance health care, provide professional and patient health-related training, and support healthcare administration. </p>
<p><strong>telemedicine</strong> is the component of telehealth that provides medical care to people at a location different from the healthcare providers. </p>
<p><strong>store-and-forward telemedicine</strong> involves acquiring data, sound, images, and video from a patient and then transmitting everything to a medical specialist for later evaluation. </p>
<p><strong>live telemedicine</strong> requires the presence of patients and healthcare providers at different sites at the same time and often involves a video conference link between the two sites. </p>
<p><strong>remote monitoring</strong> (also called home monitoring) involves the regular, ongoing, accurate measurement of an individual’s vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate) and other health measures (for example, glucose levels for a diabetic) and the transmission of this data to a healthcare provider.</p>

<p><strong>social networking platform</strong> creates an online community of Internet users that enables members to break down barriers created by time, distance, and cultural differences.
<strong>social media marketing</strong> involves the use of social networks to communicate and promote the benefits of products and services. 
<strong>organic media marketing</strong> employs tools provided by or tailored for a particular social media platform to build a social community and interact with it by sharing posts and responding to customer comments on the organization’s blog and social media accounts.
<strong>paid media marketing</strong> involves paying a third party to broadcast an organization’s display ads or sponsored messages to social media users. </p>
<p>Two common methods of charging for paid media are cost per thousand impressions and cost per click:<br />
- <strong>cost per thousand impressions (CPM)</strong> ads are billed at a flat rate per 1,000 impressions, which is a measure of the number of times an ad is displayed<br />
- <strong>cost per click (CPC)</strong> ads are paid for only when someone actually clicks on them.  </p>
<p><strong>earned media</strong> refers to the media exposure an organization gets through press and social media mentions, positive online ratings, and reviews, tweets and retweets, reposts (or “shares”), recommendations, and so on.  </p>
<p><strong>viral marketing</strong> is an approach to social media marketing that encourages individuals to pass along a marketing message to others, thus creating the potential for exponential growth in the message’s exposure and influence as one person tells two people, each of those two people tell two or three more people, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="h-1b-workers">H-1B Workers</h3>
<p>An <strong>H-1B visa</strong> is a temporary work visa granted by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for people who work in specialty occupations—jobs that require at least a four-year bachelor’s degree in a specific field, or equivalent experience.</p>
<p>Even though companies applying for H-1B visas must offer a wage that is at least 95 percent of the average salary for the occupation, some companies use H-1B visas as a way to lower salaries.  </p>
<p>Companies that employ H-1B workers are required to declare that they will not displace American workers. But companies are exempt from that requirement if 15 percent or more of their workers are on H-1B visas and the H-1B workers are paid at least $60,000 a year. Thus, H-1B workers at outsourcing firms often receive wages slightly above $60,000—below what similarly skilled American technology professionals earn, allowing those firms to offer services to U.S. companies at a lower cost, undercutting U.S. workers.  </p>
<h3 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h3>

<p>The cost advantage for offshore outsourcing to India used to be 6:1 or more—you could hire six Indian IT workers for the cost of one U.S. IT worker. The cost advantage is shrinking, and once it reaches about 1.5:1, the cost savings will no longer be much of an incentive for U.S. offshore outsourcing to India.  </p>

<p>A successful <strong>SSAE No. 16 audit report</strong> demonstrates that an outsourcing firm has effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</p>
<p>The <strong>International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No. 3402</strong>, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, was issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and is the international counterpart to SSAE No. 16.</p>
<h3 id="whistle-blowing">Whistle-Blowing</h3>
<p><strong>whistle-blowing</strong> is an effort to attract public attention to a negligent, illegal, unethical, abusive, or dangerous act by an individual or organization. In some cases, whistle-blowers are employees who act as informants on their company, revealing information to enrich themselves or to gain revenge for a perceived wrong. </p>
<p>The <strong>False Claims Act</strong>, also known as the <em>Lincoln Law</em>, was enacted during the U.S. Civil War to combat fraud by companies that sold supplies to the Union Army. War profiteers sometimes shipped boxes of sawdust instead of guns, for instance, and some swindled the Union Army into purchasing the same cavalry horses several times. When it was enacted, the act’s goal was to entice whistle-blowers to come forward by offering them a share of the money recovered.
Violators of the False Claims Act are liable for three times the dollar amount for which the government was defrauded. </p>
<p>The <strong>qui tam</strong> (“who sues on behalf of the king as well as for himself”) provision of the False Claims Act allows a private citizen to file a suit in the name of the U.S. government, charging fraud by government contractors and other entities who receive or use government funds. 
A qui tam plaintiff can receive between 15 and 30 percent of the total recovery from the defendant, depending on how helpful the person was to the success of the case.  </p>
<p>Steps for a whistle-blower to take:<br />
- Asess the seriousness of the situation<br />
- Begin documentation<br />
- Attempt to address the situation internally<br />
- Consider escalating the situation within the company<br />
- Assess the implications of becoming a whistle-blower<br />
- Use Experienced Resources to Develop an Action Plan<br />
- Execute the Action Plan<br />
- Live with the Consequences  </p>
<h3 id="green-computing">Green Computing</h3>
<p><strong>green computing</strong> is concerned with the efficient and environmentally responsible design, manufacture, operation, and disposal of IT-related products:  </p>
<p>Green computing has three goals:  </p>
<ol>
<li>reduce the use of hazardous material</li>
<li>allow companies to lower their power-related costs, and</li>
<li>enable the safe disposal or recycling of computers and computer-related equipment.</li>

<p>A junior software engineer discovers a company conspiracy to defraud the government. She hacks into a senior engineer’s workstation to preserve evidence and distributes that evidence to the press.
How would her actions be characterized?
<strong>Ethical/illegal</strong>. The junior engineer's actions could be considered ethical due to the intent to expose a conspiracy, but hacking into a workstation and distributing evidence without authorization is illegal.  </p>

Asessment  </p>
<p>What are the sources of bias? Biased AI isn't doing anything wrong; it's exposing problems that already exist in human systems.<br />
Causes:<br />
- Skewed Sample: Skewed to a group that doesn't reflect the real world.  <br />
- Limited Features: Feature collection for certain groups may not be informative or reliable.  <br />
- Tainted Examples: Unreliable labels, historical bias. <br />
- Sample Size Disparity<br />
- Proxies: Zip cod or scholl can be proxies for race. A sport can be a proxy for gender. </p>
<p>How do you solve AI bias?<br />
- Laws and Regulations<br />
- Margin of Tolerance for Bias<br />
- Cost/Accuracy vs fairness tradeoff  </p>
<ol>
<li>Identify <em>protected features</em> in your dataset: race, color, gender,...    </li>
<li>Select an appropriate "fairness metric" for your use case and value system: conditional statistical parity, false negative parity      </li>
<li><em>Build insights</em> to identify &amp; understand your mode's potential bias  </li>
<li><em>Mitigate bias</em> uncovered in your data or model  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="book-automated-decision-making-system-bias">Book, Automated decision-making system bias</h2>
<p>Chapter 3.4 and Chapter 4.4 in Computing and Technology Ethics: Engaging Through Science Fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Bias</strong> is tightly bound with a concept of fairness and typically means an inclination 
for or against some people, ideas, or things that result in treating them unfairly.  </p>
<p>Algorithms have reproduced subjective bias in harmful ways, to include:<br />
- <strong>Predictive policing</strong>: police using analytics to anticipate where crimes are 
more likely to be happening.<br />
- <strong>Weblining</strong>: alludes to "redlining", the practice of offering services such 
as home loans or insurance on a selective basis. Make resources unavailable to persons 
in poorer and minority areas.<br />
- <strong>Targeted Advertising</strong>: Retailers collect personal information to assist in 
targeting the customer's shopping habbit and interest<br />
- <strong>Sentencing Software</strong>: Decides for a judge the parole of an offender. Blacks 
were more frequently flagged as high-risk parole defendants.<br />
- <strong>Hiring and admissions</strong>: Hiring adds are placed on media platforms based on historical data. 
Algorithms sort resumes and college applications.  </p>
<p>All of the bias displayed in big data analytics replicated existing patterns of bias.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does the term “ethics washing” refer to in the context of automated decision-making systems?<br />
<strong>The development of new ethical guidelines for algorithm design.</strong> Developing ethical guidelines is an attempt to address ethical concerns, whereas "ethics washing" involves pretending that ethical issues have been resolved when they have not.  </p>
