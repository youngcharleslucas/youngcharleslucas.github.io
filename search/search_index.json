Telling Taylor the documents are frustrating is not helpful, as Taylor will not know how to improve them. To be specific, Tory should say, \"the documents you have been sending are not organized well and the formatting is inconsistent.\" Be Descriptive Tory will also need to be more detailed in her explanation. For example, she could add to the previous specific sentence by sharing, \"when I look through the documents, I am not able to see your flow of ideas because the formatting is inconsistent.\" Be Positive The feedback will be better received if Tory is able to add a positive message to her feedback. For example, adding to the above by saying, \"I really appreciate your ideas on this team, and I want to be able to take them all into consideration.\" Be Constructive Taking it another step forward and providing a constructive, actionable step for Taylor is recommended. For example, Tory could ask Taylor to look over the way a few other team members format their documents and see which ones might feel best to them to try out. Be Realistic Additionally, it is important to be realistic in the feedback you give. Imagine, for example, that Tory said to Taylor, \"I don\u2019t really understand what your documents are trying to say.\" This might be true, but it could have more to do with Tory\u2019s complex literacy skills or the amount of time she is taking to understand Taylor\u2019s work, than with the work itself. Be Relevant Lastly, it is critical for Tory to provide feedback that is directly relevant to Taylor\u2019s work. For example, it would not be productive for Tory to share that she liked the 'subject lines' of Taylor\u2019s emails. It is certainly something she could share with Taylor at another time, but for the purposes of effective formal feedback, this is not appropriate or helpful."},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D268_Communication/D268_Communication/#412-emotions-and-conflict-1","title":"4.12 Emotions and Conflict 1","text":""},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D268_Communication/D268_Communication/#414-emotional-intelligence","title":"4.14 Emotional Intelligence","text":"<p>Emotional Intelligence: Your ability to assess and manage your own emotions and  use them positively.</p> <ul> <li>\"Emotional intelligence is an individual\u2019s appraisal and expression of their emotions and the emotions of others in a manner that enhances thought, living, and communicative interactions.\"  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D268_Communication/D268_Communication/#51-what-is-a-group","title":"5.1 What is a Group","text":"<p>Group dynamics govern how the group members behave within the group, their attitudes, and their overall performance on a regular basis.

Separation is useful when conflicting individuals or groups are not working on a joint task or do not need a high degree of interaction. Although this approach does not encourage members to change their attitudes, it does provide time to seek better accommodation. Use of rules and regulations Conflict can also be reduced by clearly specifying rules, regulations, and procedures. Again, however, basic attitudes are not modified in this case. Use of integrators Integrators are individuals who are assigned a boundary-spanning role between two people or groups. In this scenario, the project manager was the integrator. To be trusted, integrators must be perceived as legitimate and knowledgeable by both groups. The integrator often takes the \u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d approach, moving from one person or group to another, identifying areas of agreement, and attempting to find areas of future cooperation. Confrontation and negotiation In this approach, competing parties are brought together face to face to discuss their basic areas of disagreement. The hope is that through open discussion and negotiation, a means can be found to resolve problems. Contract negotiations between union and management represent one such example. If a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution can be identified through these negotiations, the chances of an acceptable resolution of the conflict increase. Rotation of members By rotating from one group to another, individuals come to understand the frames of reference, values, and attitudes of other members, and communication is thus increased. When those rotated are accepted by the receiving groups, a change in attitudes as well as behavior becomes possible. This is clearly a long-term technique, as it takes time to develop good interpersonal relations and understanding among group members. Identification of shared tasks and goals A further strategy is to establish goals that require groups to work together to achieve overall success. Use of training The final technique on the continuum is training. Outside training experts are retained on a long-term basis to help groups develop relatively permanent mechanisms for working together. Structured workshops and training programs can help forge more favorable intergroup attitudes and, as a result, more constructive group behavior. <p>Adjourning Stage: The fifth stage in group forming, when group goals have been met and the group may disintegrate or start on a new project.  </p>"},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D268_Communication/D268_Communication/#section-2-lesson-5-quiz","title":"Section 2, Lesson 5 Quiz","text":"<p>Groupthink is a negative group phenomenon characterized by a lack of critical evaluation of proposed courses of action that results from high levels of cohesion and/or high conformity pressures.  </p>"},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D268_Communication/D268_Communication/#61-conflict-management-styles-1","title":"6.1 Conflict Management Styles 1","text":"<p>Competing: Individuals who employ a competing style of conflict management exhibit a low concern for the other and a high concern for self.

Not addressing the issue and choosing instead to avoid it is one strategy used by this style. Usually, but not always, a strategy of passive-aggressive behavior is used to avoid conflict.  </p> <p>Accommodating: An individual with an accommodating style is inclined to have a low concern for self and a high concern for others. While this is often viewed as a submissive and counterproductive position, context and motivation will help determine whether this is an appropriate strategy.  </p> <p>Compromising: A compromising approach to conflict indicates a low concern for self and others. While a compromise may look like a reasonable approach, it may arise from indifference and low investment in the outcome, in which case it is not advisable.

For example, a virus may be programmed to display a certain message on an infected computer\u2019s display screen, delete or modify a certain document, or reformat the hard drive.</p> <p>Worm: is a harmful program that resides in the active memory of the computer and duplicates itself. Worms differ from viruses in that they can propagate without human intervention, often sending copies of themselves to other computers by email.</p> <p>Trojan horse is a seemingly harmless program in which malicious code is hidden. A victim on the receiving end of a Trojan horse is usually tricked into opening it because it appears to be useful software from a legitimate source, such as an update for software the user currently has installed on his or her computer. The program\u2019s harmful payload might be designed to enable the hacker to destroy hard drives, corrupt files, control the computer remotely, launch attacks against other computers, steal passwords, or spy on users by recording keystrokes and transmitting them to a server operated by a third party. A Trojan horse often creates a \u201cbackdoor\u201d on a computer that enables an attacker to gain future access to the system and compromise confidential or private information.</p> <p>Another type of Trojan horse is a logic bomb, which executes when it is triggered by a specific event. For example, logic bombs can be triggered by a change in a particular file, by typing a specific series of keystrokes, or at a specific time or date.</p> <p>A blended threat is a sophisticated threat that combines the features of a virus, worm, Trojan horse, and other malicious code into a single payload.</p> <p>The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act states that it is legal to spam, provided the messages meet a few basic requirements\u2014spammers cannot disguise their identity by using a false return address, the email must include a label specifying that it is an ad or a solicitation, and the email must include a way for recipients to indicate that they do not want future mass mailings.</p> <p>A partial solution to this problem is the use of CAPTCHA to ensure that only humans obtain free accounts.

Once installed, the attacker can gain full control of the system and even obscure the presence of the rootkit from legitimate system administrators. - Rootkits are one part of a type of blended threat that consists of a dropper, a loader, and a rootkit.  - The dropper code gets the rootkit installation started and can be activated by clicking on a link to a malicious website in an email or opening an infected PDF file. The dropper launches the loader program and then deletes itself.  - The loader loads the rootkit into memory;  - at that point, the computer has been compromised.  </p> <p>An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and stays there\u2014undetected\u2014with the intention of stealing data over a long period of time (weeks or even months). </p> <p>Steps for APT:  </p> <ol> <li>Reconnaissance\u2014The intruder begins by conducting reconnaissance on the network to gain useful information about the target (security software installed, computing resources connected to the network, number of users).</li> <li>Incursion\u2014The attacker next launches incursions to gain access to the network at a low level to avoid setting off any alarms or suspicion. Some forms of spear phishing may be employed in this phase. After gaining entrance, the attacker establishes a back door, or a means of accessing a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms.</li> <li>Discovery\u2014The intruder now begins a discovery process to gather valid user credentials (especially administrative ones) and move laterally across the network, installing more back doors. These back doors enable the attacker to install bogus utilities for distributing malware that remains hidden in plain sight.</li> <li>Capture\u2014The attacker is now ready to access unprotected or compromised systems and capture information over a long period of time.</li> <li>Export\u2014Captured data are then exported back to the attacker\u2019s home base for analysis and/or used to commit fraud and other crimes.  </li> </ol> <p>phishing is the act of fraudulently using email to try to get the recipient to reveal personal data. </p> <p>Spear phishing is a variation of phishing in which the phisher sends fraudulent emails to a certain organization\u2019s employees.</p> <p>Smishing is another variation of phishing that involves the use of texting.

It would include servers used for compiling applications, if required; desktop machines required for installation testing; Web servers for Web-based applications; networked devices, if required; and so forth.</li> <li>Hardware configuration If special hardware configurations or devices are needed, a plan is required that describes the requirements, how they will be met, and when they will be needed.</li> <li>Integration Part of the test plan is a definition of how the program will be pieced together (e.g., incremental top-down testing). A system containing major subsystems or programs might be pieced together incrementally, using the top-down or bottom-up approach, for instance, but where the building blocks are programs or subsystems, rather than modules.

Its purpose is to determine whether the change has regressed other aspects of the program. It usually is performed by rerunning some subset of the program's test cases. Regression testing is important because changes and error corrections tend to be much more error prone than the original program code (in much the same way that most typographical errors in newspapers are the result of last-minute editorial changes, rather than changes in the original copy).

(2011). The Art of Software Testing (3rd) Wiley.</p> <p>User based, black-box method.  </p> <p>Considerations: - Has each user interface been tailored to the intelligence, educational background, and environmental pressures of the end user? - Are the outputs of the program meaningful, noninsulting to the user, and devoid of computer gibberish? - Are the error diagnostics, such as error messages, straightforward, or does the user need a PhD in computer science to comprehend them? For instance, does the program produce such messages as IEK022A OPEN ERROR ON FILE \u2018SYSIN\u2019 ABEND CODE=102? Messages such as these weren't all that uncommon in software systems of the 1970s and 1980s. Mass-market systems do better today in this regard, but users still will encounter unhelpful messages such as, \u201cAn unknown error has occurred,\u201d or \u201cThis program has encountered an error and must be restarted.\u201d - Programs you design yourself are under your control and should not be plagued with such useless messages. Even if you didn't design the program, if you are on the testing team, you can push for improvements in this area of the human interface. - Does the total set of user interfaces exhibit considerable conceptual integrity, an underlying consistency, and uniformity of syntax, conventions, semantics, format, style, and abbreviations? - Where accuracy is vital, such as in an online banking system, is sufficient redundancy present in the input? For example, such a system should ask for an account number, a customer name, and a personal identification number (PIN) to verify that the proper person is accessing account information. - Does the system contain an excessive number of options, or options that are unlikely to be used? One trend in modern software is to present to users only those menu choices they are most likely to use, based on software testing and design considerations. Then a well-designed program can learn from individual users and begin to present those menu items that they frequently access. Even with such an intelligent menu system, successful programs still must be designed so that accessing the various options is logical and intuitive. - Does the system return some type of immediate acknowledgment to all inputs? Where a mouse click is the input, for example, the chosen item can change color, or a button object can depress or be presented in a raised format. If the user is expected to choose from a list, the selected number should be presented on the screen when the choice is made. Moreover, if the selected action requires some processing time\u2014which is frequently the case when the software is accessing a remote system\u2014then a message should be displayed informing the user of what is going on. This level of testing sometimes is referred to as component testing, whereby interactive software components are tested for reasonable selection and user feedback. - Is the program easy to use? For example, is the input case-sensitive without making this fact clear to the user? Also, if a program requires navigation through a series of menus or options, is it clear how to return to the main menu? Can the user easily move up or down one level? - Is the design conducive to user accuracy? One test would be an analysis of how many errors each user makes during data entry or when choosing program options. Were these errors merely an inconvenience\u2014errors the user was able to correct\u2014or did an incorrect choice or action cause some kind of application failure? - Are the user actions easily repeated in later sessions? In other words, is the software design conducive to the user learning how to be more efficient in using the system? - Did the user feel confident while navigating the various paths or menu choices? A subjective evaluation might be the user response to using the application. At the end of the session did the user feel stressed by or satisfied with the outcome? Would the user be likely to choose this system for his or her own use, or recommend it to someone else? - Did the software live up to its design promise? Finally, usability testing should include an evaluation of the software specifications versus the actual operation. From the user perspective\u2014real people using the software in a real-world environment\u2014did the software perform according to its specifications?  </p> <p>You should establish practical, real-world, repeatable exercises for each user to conduct. Design these testing scenarios to present the user with all aspects of the software, perhaps in various or random order.  </p> <p>During each phase of the test, have observers document the user experience as they perform each task. When the test is complete, conduct an interview with the user or provide a written questionnaire to document other aspects of the user's experience, such as his or her perception of usage versus specification.</p> <p>In addition, write down detailed instructions for user tests, to ensure that each user starts with the same information, presented in the same way. Otherwise, you risk coloring some of the tests if some users receive different instructions.  </p> <p>A complete usability testing protocol usually involves multiple tests from the same users, as well as tests from multiple users. Why multiple tests from the same users? One area we want to test is user recall, that is, how much of what a user learns about software operation is retained from session to session.  </p>"},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D480_Software_QA/D480_Software_QA/#data-gathering","title":"Data Gathering","text":"<ul> <li>Read aloud user actions  </li> <li>remote user testing  </li> <li>Questionnaire  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Garage/WGU_Notes/D480_Software_QA/D480_Software_QA/#agile-testing","title":"Agile Testing","text":"<p>Chapter 9 of Myers, Sandler, and Badgett.
