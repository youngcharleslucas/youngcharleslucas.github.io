## Big O  

Big O is a way to categorize algorithm time or memory requirements based on input. 
It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It is a generalized measurement of 
algorithm growth.  

> As the input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?  

**Always drop constants**.  *N* represents the length of the input. If the input is 
looped through once, then the Big O is represented by \(O(N)\)
