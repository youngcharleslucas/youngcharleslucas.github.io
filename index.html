  <h1 id="aboutme">About me</h1>
    <div class ="container">
      <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>For most of my youth, I was raised in the suburbs of Kansas City (on the Kansas side). The high school I attended was on the smaller side, which meant the extra curricular activities were strained to fill positions. I played in what I could, which was football, some wrestling, pole vaulting, and trombone in the band. So for some football games other players and I would upset our coach by leaving the locker room at half time to blast instruments for our spectacular halftime show while wearing shoulder pads and all. </p>

        <p>After high school I set my path towards architecture. I attended the University of Missouri-Kansas City for two years then transferred to Kansas State University. The time spent in studio exploring the relationship between people and the space they occupy opened my mind to a new path of creativity. I sought unique approaches instead of accepting common solutions to design problems. My tactic was to break the design of things to find out if they could be rebuilt in a new way. </p>
      
        <p>I graduated during a time of recession, from the housing crash of 2008. Jobs were not looking too optimistic, and I honestly wasn’t ready to sit behind a desk. I enlisted in the Navy. Training brought me to beaches in South Carolina and the Adirondacks near Ballston Spa, NY. I joined a fast attack submarine in the submarine capital of the world, Groton, CT. The atmosphere was overwhelming, yet familiar. Our crew was small for the many responsibilities that needed to be undertaken. Like in high school, I took on many activities. At one time I was in charge of ship calibration, assisting ship’s quality assurance and ship’s diver while juggling the responsibilities of standing supervisor watches in the engine room, performing division maintenance and maintaining proficiency in my many qualifications. </p>
      
        <p>I left the Navy after 8 years of service. As a reward to myself I took some time off. I hiked 1,500 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. The first 1,000 were through California, the last 500 were in Washington. Then I joined a group called NOLS for a five and a half month adventure in Chile’s Patagonia. When I returned from Chile another global catastrophe hit. It wasn’t a housing market crash this time buy Covid-19. I sheltered with my family in Kansas for about 7 months until a friend in Salt Lake City offered me a place to stay. I have been in Utah ever since, enjoying the beauty of the West by climbing and skiing. </p>
